    "Does the relative wingspan (wingspan minus height) of an NBA player affect their overall performance? This project will focus on NBA seasons from 2018 to 2022. We select this five-season window because advanced metrics such as RAPTOR, LEBRON, and DARKO are consistently available during this period, and draft combine wingspan measurements can be matched to active NBA players. Restricting our analysis to 2018–2022 ensures metric consistency while maintaining a sufficiently large and recent sample. Our analysis will treat each player-season as one observation.\n"

    "Prior research has examined the relationship between body proportions and athletic performance. Monson et al. (2018) find that variations in limb proportions are associated with elite athletic success, suggesting that longer wingspans may confer biomechanical advantages. Similarly, Kaazempur-Mofrad (2022) argues that longer wingspans enhance defensive potential in basketball while potentially hindering shooting efficiency. These findings imply that wingspan may have heterogeneous effects across offensive and defensive dimensions of performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, existing literature primarily focuses on biomechanical mechanisms or isolated performance indicators. There has been limited examination of how wingspan relates to modern composite advanced metrics that integrate offensive and defensive contributions into single numerical estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the advanced metrics used in this study, such as RAPTOR, LEBRON, EPM, and DARKO, are composite metrics that combine both offensive and defensive components into a single numerical value. These metrics incorporate box score statistics, on/off impact, and regression-based modeling to estimate a player’s overall contribution. Since wingspan is believed to influence defensive actions such as shot contesting, deflections, and rim protection, we expect it to primarily affect the defensive components of these metrics. In contrast, True Shooting Percentage (TS%) measures scoring efficiency and does not directly incorporate defensive performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "By examining relative wingspan in relation to advanced metrics during the 2018–2022 NBA seasons, our study extends prior research by evaluating whether the defensive advantages suggested in the literature translate into measurable effects within contemporary performance models.\n",

Normal values for healthy individuals range from 70 to 100 mg/dL.  Values 100-125 are prediabetic and values >125mg/dL indicate diabetes. Values <70 indicate hypoglycemia. Fasting idicates the patient hasn't eaten in the last 8 hours.  If blood glucose is >250 or <50 at any time (regardless of the time of last meal) the patient's life may be in immediate danger\"\n",
    "   2. If there are any major concerns with the dataset, describe them. For example \"Dataset is composed of people who are serious enough about eating healthy that they voluntarily downloaded an app dedicated to tracking their eating patterns. This sample is likely biased because of that self-selection. These people own smartphones and may be healthier and may have more disposable income than the average person.  Those who voluntarily log conscientiously and for long amounts of time are also likely even more interested in health than those who download the app and only log a bit before getting tired of it\"\n",

    "### A. Data Collection\n",
    " - [X] **A.1 Informed consent**: If there are human subjects, have they given informed consent, where subjects affirmatively opt-in and have a clear understanding of the data uses to which they consent?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "       Yes, they are given informed consent considering that the data is publicly available from an officiated institution. The measurement of select variables such as match performance, height, and wingspan are also a typical practice, and are performed with the players' consent. As these types of characteristics are a core part of the industry, these players would be fully aware of and entirely comprehend the types of data that are being collected in addition to the ways in which they will be used. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.2 Collection bias**: Have we considered sources of bias that could be introduced during data collection and survey design and taken steps to mitigate those?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "       Yes, we plan to avoid the possibility of bias by using publicly available data that is grouped on a basis that does not result in any involuntary distinction. Our data will be from sports databases in which all participants, regardless of personal circumstance, are measured. As a result, we are able to retrieve the necessary metrics to perform data analysis on in an unbiased manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "       \n",
    " - [X] **A.3 Limit PII exposure**: Have we considered ways to minimize exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) for example through anonymization or not collecting information that isn't relevant for analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "        Yes, our analysis relies solely on publicly available professional statistics. We do not collect sensitive personal information beyond physical measurements and performance metrics. Therefore, the risk of exposing private identifiable information is minimal.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.4 Downstream bias mitigation**: Have we considered ways to enable testing downstream results for biased outcomes (e.g., collecting data on protected group status like race or gender)?\n",
    "\n",
    "        Yes, linking physical traits to performance may risk reinforcing deterministic interpretations of athletic ability. We emphasize that our results describe statistical associations rather than causal relationships. Additionally, advanced metrics such as RAPTOR and LEBRON rely on modeling assumptions that may embed their own biases.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Data Storage\n",
    " - [X] **B.1 Data security**: Do we have a plan to protect and secure data (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit, access controls on internal users and third parties, access logs, and up-to-date software)?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "       Yes. The data used in this project are publicly available and stored securely on password-protected devices and university-approved platforms. Since we do not collect sensitive personal information, the risk of data breaches is minimal.\n",
    "       \n",
    " - [X] **B.2 Right to be forgotten**: Do we have a mechanism through which an individual can request their personal information be removed?\n",
    "\n",
    "       Yes. The project relies solely on publicly available professional statistics. Since we do not collect or store private personal information, individuals may request removal through the original data providers rather than through our research.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **B.3 Data retention plan**: Is there a schedule or plan to delete the data after it is no longer needed?\n",
    "\n",
    "       Yes. All data used in this project will be retained only for the duration of the course and deleted after project completion. Because the dataset consists of publicly available professional statistics, no long-term retention of private information is required.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### C. Analysis\n",
    " - [X] **C.1 Missing perspectives**: Have we sought to address blindspots in the analysis through engagement with relevant stakeholders (e.g., checking assumptions and discussing implications with affected communities and subject matter experts)?\n",
    "\n",
    "       Yes. We acknowledge that our analysis focuses primarily on measurable physical traits and advanced metrics, which may not fully capture intangible aspects of basketball performance such as leadership or team dynamics. We therefore interpret our findings within the limits of quantitative data and avoid overgeneralizing beyond statistical measures.\n",
    "       \n",
    " - [X] **C.2 Dataset bias**: Have we examined the data for possible sources of bias and taken steps to mitigate or address these biases (e.g., stereotype perpetuation, confirmation bias, imbalanced classes, or omitted confounding variables)?\n",
    "\n",
    "       Yes. We recognize that wingspan data is limited to players who participated in the NBA Draft Combine, which may introduce selection bias. Additionally, omitted variables such as playing style, coaching systems, or team context may confound the relationship between physical traits and performance.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.3 Honest representation**: Are our visualizations, summary statistics, and reports designed to honestly represent the underlying data?\n",
    "\n",
    "       Yes. We will present regression results, summary statistics, and visualizations without selectively reporting significant findings. Effect sizes, limitations, and uncertainty measures (e.g., standard errors) will be clearly displayed to avoid overstating conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.4 Privacy in analysis**: Have we ensured that data with PII are not used or displayed unless necessary for the analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "       Yes. Our analysis relies solely on publicly available professional statistics and does not involve sensitive personal information. No private identifiable data will be displayed or analyzed.\n",
    "\n",
    "       \n",
    " - [X] **C.5 Auditability**: Is the process of generating the analysis well documented and reproducible if we discover issues in the future?\n",
    "\n",
    "       Yes. All data processing and analysis steps will be documented and reproducible through code. We will clearly document variable definitions, cleaning procedures, and model specifications to ensure transparency and future review.\n",
    "\n",
    "       \n",
    "### D. Modeling\n",
    " - [X] **D.1 Proxy discrimination**: Have we ensured that the model does not rely on variables or proxies for variables that are unfairly discriminatory?\n",
    "\n",
    "       Yes. Our model relies on physical measurements and performance statistics that are directly related to basketball evaluation. We do not include sensitive demographic variables such as race or socioeconomic status, and we avoid using variables that may serve as proxies for protected characteristics.\n",
    "       \n",
    " - [X] **D.2 Fairness across groups**: Have we tested model results for fairness with respect to different affected groups (e.g., tested for disparate error rates)?\n",
    "\n",
    "       Yes. Although our study does not focus on demographic group comparisons, we recognize that physical traits may correlate with positional differences. We interpret results cautiously and do not claim fairness implications across demographic groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "       \n",
    " - [X] **D.3 Metric selection**: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?\n",
    "\n",
    "       Yes. We consider multiple advanced metrics, including composite measures (RAPTOR, LEBRON, DARKO) and efficiency metrics (TS%), to avoid relying on a single definition of performance. This allows us to assess whether the relationship with wingspan is consistent across different measurement frameworks.\n",
    "\n",
    "       \n",
    " - [X] **D.4 Explainability**: Can we explain in understandable terms a decision the model made in cases where a justification is needed?\n",
    "\n",
    "       Yes. We use linear regression models, which allow clear interpretation of coefficients and effect sizes. This enables us to explain how changes in relative wingspan are associated with changes in performance metrics in understandable terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "       \n",
    " - [X] **D.5 Communicate limitations**: Have we communicated the shortcomings, limitations, and biases of the model to relevant stakeholders in ways that can be generally understood?\n",
    "\n",
    "       Yes. We will clearly communicate model limitations, including selection bias, omitted variables, and the non-causal nature of our analysis. This ensures stakeholders understand the scope and boundaries of our findings.\n",
    "\n",
    "### E. Deployment\n",
    " - [X] **E.1 Monitoring and evaluation**: Do we have a clear plan to monitor the model and its impacts after it is deployed (e.g., performance monitoring, regular audit of sample predictions, human review of high-stakes decisions, reviewing downstream impacts of errors or low-confidence decisions, testing for concept drift)?\n",
    "\n",
    "       Yes. Although this project is conducted for academic purposes and not deployed in production, we will evaluate model robustness through diagnostic checks and sensitivity analysis. Any unexpected results will prompt re-examination of data processing and model specification.\n",
    "       \n",
    " - [X] **E.2 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?\n",
    "\n",
    "       Yes. Since this model is used only for academic analysis, it does not directly affect individuals. However, if concerns arise regarding interpretation or misuse, we will revise our analysis and clarify limitations to prevent harm.\n",
    "       \n",
    " - [X] **E.3 Roll back**: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?\n",
    "\n",
    "       Yes. Because the model is not deployed in a live production environment, it can be revised or discontinued at any stage. Any issues identified during analysis will result in modification or removal of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "       \n",
    " - [X] **E.4 Unintended use**: Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?\n",
    "\n",
    "       Yes. We recognize that findings linking physical traits to performance could be misused in scouting or evaluation contexts. We therefore emphasize that our results describe statistical associations and should not be interpreted as deterministic or prescriptive guidelines."
