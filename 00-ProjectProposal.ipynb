    "Most humans have about a 1:1 height to wingspan ratio. However, when it comes to athletic endeavors, some combination of features can lead to greater outcomes, for example Michael Phelps is frequently cited as being anatomically perfect to perform in the sport of swimming. We plan to examine wingspan in NBA players to see if players with longer wingspans tend to have better outcomes in the NBA. Better outcomes will be quantified using Robust Algorithm using Player Tracking and On/Off Ratings (RAPTOR), estimated plus-minus (EPM), luck-adjusted player estimate using a box prior regularized on-off (LEBRON), daily adjusted and regressed kalman optimized (DARKO), net rating, and true shooting. \n",
    "RAPTOR represents the overall influence on the match that a player has depending on when they are on or off the court.\n",
    "EPM further elicits the individual impact that a player has by splitting offensive and defensive value and compensating for outside influences.\n",
    "LEBRON the random environmental chance that affects the offensive and defensive impact of a player on the match into account and also relative to their positions. \n",
    "DARKO helps to normalize the history of a player and places slightly more weight on their recent statistics. \n",
    "Net rating calculates the differences between the offensive and defensive rating, finding the primary type of impact that a player has on a match.\n",
    "True Shooting: an advanced NBA statistic measuring scoring efficiency by accounting for 2-point field goals, 3-point field goals, and free throws in one metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "We found two studies that analyze wingspan in basketball. The first study, “Allometric Variation in Modern Humans and the Relationship Between Body Proportions and Elite Athletic Success”, suggests that there are benefits to having longer wingspans. In the second study, “Basketball Players’ Long Wingspan Enhances Defensive Upside but Hinders Shooting Capabilities”, the researcher comes to the conclusion that long wingspans contribute to defensive capabilities, but hinder shooting capabilities.\n",

    "Our main hypothesis about the answer to our question is that there may be a positive correlation between player wingspan and a player’s overall performance. The reason for this is that with a longer wingspan, a player may be able to have a wider area of influence which allows them to perform more effectively\n",
    "Our current understanding is that usually longer wingspans positively affect defensive value, as it is easier to block shots and deflect the ball with a longer reach, and that people with wider bodies tend to be stronger. (longer arms/wider bodies). We're also not sure how exactly wingspan affects offensive potential, as it seems that there are more unique outcomes for what leads to good offense. For now, we will say that, because of the prior work we have read, it may affect offense negatively because it affects shooting negatively. In terms of overall performance, the Defensive benefits seem to surpass the offense negatives, so there will be a net positive from having a longer wingspan. "

We will be using publicly available data that is centered on widely known individuals within a field that commonly uses these types of data. As this is a sport and the datasets will include any players that were present during the seasons, there should not be any selection biases present within our data as well. This is a result of approaching the data in a way that personal circumstances or details will be disregarded, except for the wingspan which is the subject of our analysis. Our approach to data will be investigative, so we will not have a reason for biasing our analysis in any particular direction\n",

    " - [X] **A.1 Informed consent**: If there are human subjects, have they given informed consent, where subjects affirmatively opt-in and have a clear understanding of the data uses to which they consent?\n",
    "       Yes, they are given informed consent considering that the data is publicly available from an officiated institution. The measurement of select variables such as match performance, height, and wingspan are also a typical practice, and are performed with the players' consent. As these types of characteristics are a core part of the industry, these players would be fully aware of and entirely comprehend the types of data that are being collected in addition to the ways in which they will be used. \n",

    " - [X] **A.2 Collection bias**: Have we considered sources of bias that could be introduced during data collection and survey design and taken steps to mitigate those?\n",
    "       Yes, we plan to avoid the possibility of bias by using publicly available data that is grouped on a basis that does not result in any involuntary distinction. Our data will be from sports databases in which all participants, regardless of personal circumstance, are measured. As a result, we are able to retrieve the necessary metrics to perform data analysis on in an unbiased manner. \n",
    " - [X] **A.3 Limit PII exposure**: Have we considered ways to minimize exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) for example through anonymization or not collecting information that isn't relevant for analysis?\n",

    "### B. Data Storage\n",
    " - [ ] **B.1 Data security**: Do we have a plan to protect and secure data (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit, access controls on internal users and third parties, access logs, and up-to-date software)?\n",
    " - [X] **B.2 Right to be forgotten**: Do we have a mechanism through which an individual can request their personal information be removed?\n",

    " - [X] **C.2 Dataset bias**: Have we examined the data for possible sources of bias and taken steps to mitigate or address these biases (e.g., stereotype perpetuation, confirmation bias, imbalanced classes, or omitted confounding variables)?\n",
    " - [X] **C.3 Honest representation**: Are our visualizations, summary statistics, and reports designed to honestly represent the underlying data?\n",
    " - [X] **C.4 Privacy in analysis**: Have we ensured that data with PII are not used or displayed unless necessary for the analysis?\n",

    " - [ ] **D.2 Fairness across groups**: Have we tested model results for fairness with respect to different affected groups (e.g., tested for disparate error rates)?\n",
    " - [X] **D.3 Metric selection**: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?\n",

    " - [ ] **E.2 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?\n",
    " - [X] **E.3 Roll back**: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?\n",
